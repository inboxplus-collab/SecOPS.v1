# Training runners

This package is the integration point for training and fine-tuning stacks used by the platform. Add runner modules per vendor and keep shared helpers here (data loading, config parsing, logging adapters).

For runnable examples and detailed setup steps, see `docs/llm-finetuning-guide.md`.
