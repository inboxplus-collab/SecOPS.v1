## LLM Training & Fine-Tuning
This repository now includes guidance for integrating popular LLM training stacks (Unsloth, nanoGPT, LLaMA-Factory, and LLMs From Scratch) with our backend and infra. See [docs/llm-finetuning-guide.md](docs/llm-finetuning-guide.md) for setup steps and data format expectations.

A scaffolded package lives at `backend/src/training/` for runner implementations.
